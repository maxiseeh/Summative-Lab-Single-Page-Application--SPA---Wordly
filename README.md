# Wordly Dictionary App

This is my dictionary web application for the Summative Lab assignment. It lets users search for words and see their definitions using a free dictionary API.

## What it does

- Search for English words
- Shows word definitions and meanings
- Displays pronunciation if available
- Plays audio pronunciation
- Shows synonyms that you can click on
- Handles errors when words are not found

## Files in this project

- `index.html` - The main webpage structure
- `styles.css` - Makes the page look nice with colors and layout
- `script.js` - JavaScript code that makes everything work
- `README.md` - This file explaining the project

## How to use it

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
2. Type a word in the search box
3. Click the Search button or press Enter
4. Look at the results that show up

## What I learned

- How to use HTML forms and input elements
- CSS styling with colors, padding, and layout
- JavaScript event listeners for button clicks
- How to use fetch() to get data from APIs
- DOM manipulation to update the webpage
- Error handling for when things go wrong

## API used

I used the Free Dictionary API from https://dictionaryapi.dev/ to get word data.

## Problems I solved

- Making the search work when you press Enter or click the button
- Showing loading messages while waiting for results
- Handling cases when words are not found
- Making synonyms clickable to search for new words
- Playing audio pronunciation when available

## Future improvements

- Add a favorites list to save words
- Make it work on mobile phones better
- Add more languages besides English
- Save search history
